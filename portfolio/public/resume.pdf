UNC DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSCIENCE							                   Chapel Hill, NC
  Undergraduate Research Assistant – Honors Thesis Student – Christoffel Lab		        Aug 2023 – May 2024
* Authored senior thesis on the development of an automated behavioral classifier (ABC) for aggression and social interaction in ASD (autism spectrum disorder) mouse models using DeepLabCut-based locomotion metrics.
* Defended thesis to a neuroscience faculty panel, showcasing classifier performance and validation techniques on previously untested videos of ASD model mice interacting with wildtype mice. ABC was 15% more accurate at identifying periods of aggressive behavior than a human annotator.
* Performed statistical analysis, including hierarchical clustering and PCA on c-Fos expression data to identify region-specific neural activation patterns across mouse groups.
* Interpreted neural clustering results in the context of brain region functionality and behavioral phenotypes, contributing to ASD correlation with c-Fos protein aggregation
