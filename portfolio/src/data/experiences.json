      "Defended thesis to a neuroscience faculty panel led by Dr. Daniel Christoffel, showcasing classifier performance and validation techniques on previously untested videos of ASD model mice interacting with wildtype mice. ABC was 15% more accurate at identifying periods of aggressive behavior than a human annotator",
      "Performed statistical analysis, including hierarchical clustering and PCA on c-Fos expression data to identify region-specific neural activation patterns across mouse groups",
      "Interpreted neural clustering results in the context of brain region functionality and behavioral phenotypes, contributing to ASD correlation with c-Fos protein aggregation"
