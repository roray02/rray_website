    "description": "Cloud-based software platform for standardized automated pain assessment in mouse models through facial grimace analysis. Assisted in development of machine learning pipeline exploring tools like DeepLabCut and DeepEthogram for precise facial landmark detection and DeepEthogram for behavioral classification to identify four key facial action units (orbitals, nose, ears, whiskers). The computer vision system generates up to one grimace score per second from standard 30fps video, providing objective pain assessment on a 0-8 scale. Validated across multiple laboratories and pain-inducing conditions, demonstrating that mice exhibit 7x more high grimace behavior following surgical procedures compared to controls.",

Developed an analysis tool utilizing DeepLabCut for feature extraction to quantify stress-induced aggression and social interactions with 15% higher accuracy than human annotation. The classifier addresses challenges in ASD treatment by providing objective, scalable behavioral assessment that reduces unconscious bias and supports development of pharmacologic interventions with fewer side effects. Source code access restricted due to proprietary research data and institutional compliance requirements. Project presented at UNC Undergraduate Research Symposium and published in the UNC Honors Thesis repository.",
